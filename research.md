My research is in number theory, with a focus on the arithmetic theory of quadratic forms. More specifically, I have been studying regularity conditions on quadratic forms in the contet of a higher dimensional analogue to the representation problem. My graduate thesis work is a finiteness result for positive definite strictly n-regular integral quadratic forms.
