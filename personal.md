When I am not doing math, I enjoy spending time with my cats Lenore and Jenny.

I also actively advocate for the animal protection organization, [Farm Sanctuary](http://www.FarmSanctuary.org). To learn more about the animals they rescue, please visit their blog [Animals of Farm Sanctuary](http://www.animalsoffarmsanctuary.com).
